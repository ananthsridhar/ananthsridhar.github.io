The kind of person that gets excited that something has an API

The kind of person that gets excited when something has an API. Also the kind of person that goes googly eyed over Dogs, Bajji and Vada Pav.

Ananth is the sort of person that gets excited when something has an API. Ananth is also the sort of person that loves Bajji, Vada Pav, Dogs and talking
about himself in third person. Loves to immerse himself in code during his free time and thinking about very deep things while listening to random
Spotify playlists. Someday he hopes to enter the Stand Up comic scene, but not today. On rainy weekends he likes to sit in and transport himself across graphically created worlds
on the laptop he cleans four times a day, on other days you might catch him cycling to the beach in the evenings, quickly restocking the calories he burnt with hot bajji.
